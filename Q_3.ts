// Define two variables, age and life. For age, just set a value like 34 without specifying its type. Hover over age to see its implicit type. For life, set the value as 56 and explicitly define its type as age: number to see its explicit type.


let age = 34    //implicit type
let life: number= 56  //explicit type
let sum: number= age + life
console.log(sum);
